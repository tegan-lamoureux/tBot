# tBot

A small, fully operational IRC bot.
Cajun Slang - Used in front of any name, “T” means petit (little). T-Sam, etc.

Usage (Written for Python 3):
`$ python tBot.py`

Configuration:
All options for the bot (server, nickname, ssl, etc) are currently specified by setting global variables at the top of the program.

Note: This is a work in progress, and while it is functional, it is severely limited. It was written only as a proof of concept to myself, and an excersise in sockets & IRC protocol.
